- libinput gestures
- handle multiple devices with same vendor/product
- forward source to multiple destinations
- link specific transforms
- queue link switching
    - only allow one link in queue
    - don't queue current link

    - fake vendor/product for generic devices?
- transform input event type (EV_KEY, EV_REL), possibly also code
    - limit performance impact
- logitech receiver (16461) vs keyboard/mouse (50475)
